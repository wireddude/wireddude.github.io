## Things I did this weekend while sick.

Installed a ZNC server for persistent IRC from my iPhone using. I'm thinking I still find IRC more interesting than slack. The server uses ngrok.io to let me use the server from anywhere on the internet. Auto-paid my AT&T cellphone bill. It’s $66 for 5GB, but I have lots of rollover data. Migrated my blog from dmkanter.github.io on jekyll to wireddude.herokuapp.com running on Ghost. But I think I'm going to dual-post for a while until I figure out a better system. I still can't import my old wordpress or jekyll stuff into ghost yet. Still not perfect, but it’s pretty cool. Updated my dns to chat.davidkanter.com points to my rocket.chat server installed in the cloud on heroku. Learned a lot about heroku actually, auto-deployed lots of apps and tried their amazing “add-ons” for free. Also setup wordpress on heroku for free anyhow because 1) it's free and I had a recent copy of my sql database I was able to import into the heroku cleardb instance. (Did I mention it's all free there for 1 dyno?) Installed jenkins on a docker node using tutum and digital ocean. Pretty amazing stuff. Reconfigured my plant bot connected to my plant and raspberry pi so it would message my cloud version of rocket.chat on heroku instead of my local pi version. Used ngrok to setup etherpad on my pi. Updated Little Snitch on both my laptops.
